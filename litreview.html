			<h1>Perceptions of social networking among users and non-users</h1>
			<p>Social Networking Site (SNS) use has increased massively in recent years, although there are still a number of people that choose to avoid using them. This review focuses on literature that studies the personalities of users and non-users of SNSs, and how this may affect their perceptions of these websites. The studied literature has several consistent themes: the reasons for and against using SNSs, statistics on the ratio of users to non-users, and the possible dangers that social networking can have, particularly on children. The aim of this review is to display differing opinions and statistics and decide how future research can be improved in this topic area.</p>
			<p>SNSs have become increasingly popular as people have had more and more reasons to join them. Of samples of young adults, 85% confirmed having a Facebook profile in 2008 (Ross, Orr, E., Sisic, Arseneault, Simmering, & Orr, R., 2008) compared to 92% in 2013 (Ljepava, Orr, Locke, & Ross, 2013). Among adults, the increase was even greater, with an estimated 35% using SNSs in 2008 (Lenhart, 2009) compared to 73% today (Duggan & Smith, 2013). Most of these studies appear to agree that the growth in SNS has been due to users wanting to strengthen their existing social circle, for example, people use SNSs to “reinforce important offline relationships” rather than to meet new people online (Subrahmanyam, Reich, Waechter, & Espinoza, 2008). Another study would suggest otherwise, as 79% of its participants said they used Facebook “to meet interesting people”, whereas only 60% would use it “to stay in touch with people [they] know” (Park, Kee, & Valenzuela, 2009). Arguably, Park et al.’s study may be more accurate as respondents were able to select multiple options for their views on social networks, for example, they could use Facebook to keep in touch with their offline friends and meet new people as well. It has been suggested that other factors for SNS use such as peer pressure may be involved, particularly among teenagers and young adults, whom also admit to using SNSs “to make themselves look cool” (Park et al., 2009). Although the majority of SNS users access them for social reasons, others have expressed interest in using sites like Facebook for educational purposes. For example, certain schools and universities have set up Facebook or Twitter accounts to communicate with students, with the idea that students will be more enticed to follow school news and events and access library services (Roblyer, McDaniel, Webb, Herman, & Witty, 2010). Additionally, many students use SNSs to discuss homework or exams with their peers, meaning that some students already keep education in mind when visiting a SNS. In more recent years, SNSs have implemented instant messaging features, causing a slight decline in users of instant messaging services. The implementation of features like this for SNSs has resulted in SNSs being the ‘go-to’ place for many internet users, with everything they need from the internet being in one place. Finally, it has been reported that users actually see sites like Twitter as a news source, although “people don’t actively look for news, but instead news finds them”, in that people share links to news articles with one another (Santoro, 2013).</p>
			<p>It is important to distinguish between non-users of social networks and those that are simply unaware of their existence, though this is extremely uncommon as shown by Hargittai (2007) - only 1 person in 1060 had never heard of a social networking site. In most of the literature reviewed, non-users referred to people who claim to have a reason for not joining an SNS. Lampe, Vitak, & Ellison (2013) state that “when asked about why they had chosen to not use Facebook, non-adopters responses fell into five categories”, which all had an underlying theme – that non-users simply didn’t see any benefits to joining. One of the more interesting categories is “Channel effects” – in which respondents stated that conversations over SNSs were far more impersonal and less authentic, one person saying that “much more can be accomplished through a simple conversation” (Lampe et al., 2013). Wilson, Fornasier, & White (2010) disagree on this, claiming that conversations over SNSs may actually be easier for young people with low self-esteem, and that “the Internet has the potential to relieve some of the social anxiety that people with low self-esteem often experience in more traditional interpersonal situations” (Wilson et al., 2010). Subrahmanyam et al. (2008) found quite different results in their study. Non-users were asked if not having an account on a SNS affected them, to which 63% said no, 21% “felt somewhat cut off from their face-to-face friends” and 13% felt that they were pressured to register an account. In Lampe et al. (2013)’s study, non-users were much clearer about their reasons for not joining a SNS, whereas according to Subrahmanyam et al. (2008), most non-users were not affected by SNSs in any way. A possible explanation for the difference in these two studies is that they are five years apart, and it is likely that with the growth of social networking, many of the non-users whom were unaffected by not having a profile saw a reason to create an account before the 2013 study. This would leave two groups of people; those that have reasons for non-use, and those that now perceive SNSs in a positive way. Interestingly, “internet efficacy” (or one’s technical abilities regarding the web) was “not significantly associated with the likelihood of being a Facebook member” (Lampe et al., 2013), suggesting that people’s perceptions of SNSs do not change based on their ability or experience on the Internet.</p>
			<p>Although the majority of studies on SNS use focus on teenagers and adults, it is also important to consider how children under 13 view social networks, and whether they are aware of the potential risks. In 2011, 43% of 9-12 year olds in the UK had social networking profiles, despite most sites having an age requirement of 13 (“Many under-13s ‘using Facebook’”, 2011). The reason for this age requirement is clear in a study on middle school students by Kite, Gable, & Filippelli (2010), in which an alarming number of young students were found to be unaware of dangers on SNSs, including internet predators. Kite’s study presents some worrying statistics: only 40% of respondents said they would tell an adult if they were contacted by someone they didn’t know on the internet. “The fear is, perhaps, that they would not be allowed to continue using the Internet if this were to happen” Kite et al. (2010) explain, and go on to say that parents should be more involved in their children’s online actions to prevent them from being contacted in the first place. The study concludes that 63% of children “do not fully understand the potential risk of Internet predators”. Livingstone & Brake (2009) believe that the problem isn’t as big as Kite et al. (2010) make it out to be, claiming that  most children can be sensible on the internet, “with communication primarily used to sustain local friendships already established offline, rather than to make new contacts with distant strangers” (Livingstone & Brake, 2009). The other major issue associated with SNS use among young students is cyber-bullying, with an estimated 49% of teenagers and young adults claiming to have had at least one incident in which they were bullied online in the last year, according to a recent study (Wang, 2013). This is a significant improvement from 2009, in which 72% of 12-17 year olds claimed to have been harassed on the internet (Livingstone & Brake, 2009) however a large percentage of these students reported that they would not tell an adult if they had been the victim of cyber-bullying (Kite et al., 2010). The studies given do not investigate what percentage of cyber-bullying is encountered via SNSs, which may be a point for future research when looking at why young students and teenagers do not use SNSs. In one study, it was found that some parents purposely avoid SNSs to discourage their children from using them, claiming that they may not “behave as well on-line as they do in face-to-face interactions” (Lampe et al., 2013). According to Kite et al. (2010), “it is clear that more education on the risk of cyber behaviors is needed”, and simply discouraging children is not enough.</p>
			<p>As SNSs are becoming more and more commonplace each year, it is important that academic studies are carried out often, in order to observe people’s reactions to changes in the social networking scene (for example if a new SNS was introduced). In future, more research should be carried out into the viewpoints of non-users, as identified by Ross et al. (2009), though this is becoming increasingly difficult as there are much fewer non-users now compared to several years ago. Frequent studies should also be carried out in regards to the dangers of social networking and how children perceive SNSs, as it has been made clear that issues such as cyber-bullying are still very prominent among young students in particular.</p>
